            <p> My best friend and I came up with the idea on June 29th, 2020, back when I was about halfway done running every street of Fairfield. On May 23rd, 2021, the idea finally got off the back burner and came to life - I ran 11.2 miles in Thompson, CT to start my journey.

            <p> Just 12 days after running every street of Fairfield I found myself starting down Woodlawn Avenue in New London, my college town.

            <p>	
            Itching to see something new during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, I set off on Split Rock Road on April 3, 2020. Between that time and August 24th of the same year, when I ran down Mulberry Hill Road, I discovered so much of a place that I 
            thought I previously knew like the back of my hand.

          <h2>Racing The Clock</h2>
          <div class="scrollable-content">
            <h3>Track</h3>
            <p>In track season I specialized in the 10K, the longest race available at the collegiate level. I ran my college best of 32:33.88 in April 2022, shortly after running 116 miles in one week (the most I ever have).
              The experience was yet another symnbol of hard work paying off, as I beat the 32:35 required to run <a href="https://www.neicaaa.net/_files/ugd/9d74ab_0a0ebd79d27b4e2b8478d8459d4771d5.pdf">NEICAAAs</a>, a New England championship meet across all three NCAA divisions.
            </p>
            <p>Otherwise, I also ran the 5K (PR of 15:33.65), the mile (PR of 4:38.40) and other distances on occasion.
            </p>
            <h3>Cross Country</h3>
            <p>The highlight of my cross country experience at Conn was the team qualifying for nationals my senior year. While the team usually sends individuals, this was the first team apperance on DIII's largest stage in exactly 20 years!
              My individual role was small, but not insignificant: I was often the sixth or seventh runner for the Conn College Camels, being just outside of scoring position (top five) for our team but displacing the scores of the teams around us.
              I am still grateful for the hard work every teammate gave, especially those often in the scoring five, for having created the nationals oppurtunity they did.
