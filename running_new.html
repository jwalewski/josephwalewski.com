    <h2>Running</h2>
    <p>Running has been my favorite sport since 7th grade. Wether it's scenic trails, dyanmic cityscapes, or refreshing beahces, I always enjoy getting miles in. The following is a rough summary of my running career:</p>

        <h2>A Journey of a Lifetime</h2>
        <div class="scrollable-content">
          <p> My best friend and I came up with the idea on June 29th, 2020, back when I was about halfway done running every street of Fairfield. On May 23rd, 2021, the idea finally got off the back burner and came to life - I ran 11.2 miles in Thompson, CT to start my journey. As I type this on July 8th, 2022, I am almost exactly halfway done, and my completion of a 600 mile loop around my home state will be the culumination of my running exploration. As covered by Fairfield HamletHub... </p>

        <h2>Always Finding New Roads</h2>
        <div class="scrollable-content">
          <p> Just 12 days after running every street of Fairfield I found myself starting down Woodlawn Avenue in New London, my college town. As I found myself essentially repeating my previous challenge I again gained so much perspective on a community which I previously thought I was familar with. As I wrote in a short reflection after finishing, "I discovered a whole new set of stories that are just as much Connecticut as the place I grew up." Running every street of New London made me also appreciate the divide between college students and permanent residents, and how simply seeing the whole city began to ammend it - I will never forget how amazing it felt on April 21st, 2021, I heard a man say "hey, didn't you run every street of New London?" </p>

        <h2>My First Research Experience</h2>
        <div class="scrollable-content">
          <p>	My first research experience was the final portion of a year long genetics course at Exeter. The fall term assumed no prior genetics knowledge and provided an introduction to heritability, mendelian genetics, and concepts including dominance, recessiveness, incomplete dominance, and codominance. With this information we solved complex heritability problems, learned about the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and began to explore the molecular basis for the phenomena we observed. 
            Throughout the winter term we went into great detail about many of the classic mechanisms of gene regulation throughout all living organisms, ranging from Rho factor in bacteria to chromatin compaction in eukaryotes (more complex organisms such as people, plants, and anything else multicellular). 
            The spring section of the course was the research experience created by Stanford University. To be able to take this section one had to apply and admission to the course had a 25% acceptance rate dependent on the student’s grades, recommendations from previous biology and chemistry teachers at Exeter, and a personal statement. I was unbelievably grateful to be admitted to the course and begin my career as a scientist.
            I was first responsible for husbandry of four drosophila melanogaster breeding lines while class time revolved around understanding the genetic modifications they had. Each line had the same transposable element, the P element, but due to its transposable nature it could move around throughout the genome as different generations of flies came and went in each line. After a few generations, we were told to be on the lookout for “hallelujah males” - male flies which had the transposable element stabilized due to their configuration of homozygous lethal chromosomes.  
            With our lines stabilized to halt further P element movement, we could then characterize the location by sequencing the element and the surrounding portion of the genome. However, since the P element could be nearly anywhere in the genome, we had to be innovative: inverse PCR allowed us to “snip” out the P element and a small portion of the surrounding region, which we could then sequence. We were taught this technique along with fly larva dissection, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence to further study our P element’s expression (usage). Since the P element contained GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) we could see where the gene was actively being read simply by looking at which parts of the larva lit up. One of my lines had the P element insert next to a gene regulating proton pumps in neurons. The dissection of its brain is the background image for this experience. 
            I am incredibly proud to say that this work resulted in me being listed as a co-author on the paper, which can be found <a href="https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/9/7/2097/6026785">here</a>.

        <h2>The Start of it All</h2>
        <div class="scrollable-content">
          <p>Even before formally beginning a scientific career I’ve always had both a great passion for and curiosity about the natural world. From the time I could talk I wanted to learn more about the ocean and all life within it, and soon after I discovered some brightly colored salamanders at a family friend’s lake house in upstate New York. After this, I completely fell in love with eastern newts, catching some and watching them navigate both terrestrial and aquatic environments. One summer day in 2011 I was at a local pond with my dad and managed to catch a green frog that, interestingly enough, had five feet. The extra appendage sprouted off the lower right leg, effectively functioning as a second copy. My natural curiosity skyrocketed and I rushed over to my dad, wondering how this could have happened. He told me that it was likely due to chemicals in the environment, but also reminded me that newts are capable of regrowing limbs. He then handed me some science articles about how amphibians grow limbs and I fell in love with the topic immediately. To this day my primary interest in science is understanding how exactly salamander tissue regeneration happens. One day I hope it would be possible to apply this knowledge to treatment for human conditions ranging from amputee survivors to those affected by neurodegenerative diseases. I see endless possibilities and this is what has motivated me for many years.</p>
